        Join our back-end teams building user-friendly online services for
        consumers. We use a micro-services architecture with a broad range of
        different technology stacks and high levels of automated test coverage.
        The majority of our back-end is written in Ruby.

        <strong>Highlights</strong>
      </p>
      \n
      <ul>
        \n
        <li>
          Scale and performance challenges. Handle tens of thousands of rpm,
          scale across geographically distributed datacenters, solve complex
          computational tasks quickly, and be highly available.
        </li>
        \n<li>Security. We work with world-class penetration testers.</li>\n
        <li>
          API design. We have client-side apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS,
          Linux, routers, and browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and
          Safari. Keep the API designs simple and meet the various requirements
          for our apps.
        </li>
        \n
        <li>
          Split-testing. We make heavy use of A/B testing to optimize our
          front-end for sales conversions. We have enough volume to often get
          significant results within one day.

            Your responsibilities may cover systems that each bring their own
            set of interesting technical and design challenges, especially
            around scale, security, and availability.

            Microservices architecture. We can pick the right stack for each
            individual application. Currently those involve combinations of

            Docker, Chef and Ansible.
